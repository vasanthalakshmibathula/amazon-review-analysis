MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this.  After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect error.  If anyone has a similar problem, I'd recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item.  This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card:I don't need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I didn't count off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might be relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed ""read speeds up to 30 MB/s for fast file transfer.""  Then again, running on a second PC using a different USB 2.0 card reader, none of the speeds even hit 5 MB/s, so this seems to be highly system-dependent.I only just got the card this week, and so far it works on *select* SDXC-compatible devices and exFAT-compatible operating systems:  some SDXC-compatible devices, such as the Panasonic HDC-TM40, do not allow cards larger than 64 GB (for whatever reason); this was stated in the manual, and I've confirmed this card is recognized as broken/corrupt/unusable in that device, whereas 64 GB exFAT cards work fine.  The 128 GB works fine (with original exFAT formatting) in my Toshiba Excite 7.7 Android tablet, and (predictably) not at all in my non-SDXC-compatible Galaxy Note 2 (though it possibly would if reformatted to FAT32, since a 64 GB card in FAT32 works fine there).I'll update my review to reflect any problems, issues, etc that I notice in the coming days & weeks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World : [url removed as per Amazon rules]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read : 18.694 MB/sSequential Write : 11.921 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 18.502 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 0.680 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.339 MB/s [ 815.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 1.581 MB/s [ 386.1 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 3.151 MB/s [ 769.4 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 1.564 MB/s [ 381.8 IOPS]Test : 1000 MB [G: 0.0% (0.0/119.1 GB)] (x5)Date : 2014/04/24 16:53:49OS : Windows XP Professional SP3 [5.1 Build 2600] (x86)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, published April 24, 2013:This is a high-quality card.  I've used it in a variety of devices, through multiple readers on different pcs, in an HD camcorder using a micro to full-sized SD adapter, and I've never once had a problem with it.  It even works at full capacity in *some* microSDHC-only devices once its reformatted to FAT32 (such as my SanDisk Clip+ FLAC player and supposedly even PSPs via a proper adapter, though I haven't yet tested my PSP).  I keep anticipating someone coming out with a card with equal or better capacity and speeds at a comparable price, but I haven't seen one yet.  If these were cheaper, I'd have several by now.Make sure your device can handle micro or full-sized SDXC cards, or is one of those rare gems that state they support only as high as SDHC but have been tested to work with SDXC cards such as this one once they've been manually reformatted to FAT32.",24-04-2013,593,3,0,3,3,1,0.438502968

VERY impressive service from Amazon!As has already been reported, the card formats out to > 59 Gb, and it performs perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy S III (which is also new).  Using two card readers on a fast PC, I transferred everything from my old 16GB card to the new 64 GB card in less time than it took to walk to the kitchen and get a cup of coffee.  So I think the Class 10 rating is correct on the card.Once I have some experience with the card in the phone, I'll benchmark the card and I'll also benchmark operations such as internally backing up my Android phone to the card.  Then I'll update this review with some accurate numerical data.  But in the mean time on first look, the person who said that the S 3 has problems with anything faster than class 6 may not have been correct - a full backup of the phone to the card was significantly faster than the backup with the old 16GB class 6 card.  Again no benchmarks yet but once I have them I'll include them here.Right now I'm very happy with this card and I'm really impressed - both with the card and with the unbelievably quick service from Amazon (and I'm in Atlanta where shipments like this one often take the full 3 days to arrive).",25-07-2012,866,15,6,21,9,0.714285714,0.500436193

121,A. Lee,5,"Update: providing an update with regard to SanDisk support.I bought the memory card in Aug 2012 (see original review below). In May of 2013 while on my cruise to Alaska the card went bad. During the sailing out of San Francisco it was fine as I used it to take a panorama shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. For most of the cruise I was using my DSLR but the next time I wanted to use my cell phone, the phone told me I had no memory card loaded.  Any way, tested the card on my laptop when I got back and it couldn't recognize it. I contacted SanDisk via email and provide them copy of my receipt from Amazon along with the serial number on the back of the card (very hard to read) and no problems; they told me to send them back the card and they sent me a brand new card which is now still functioning in my cell phone.  Great support provide by SanDisk. No hassle as long as you can provide proof of purchase (easy to do since Amazon keeps my entire purchase history/invoices online).  One reason I buy directly from Amazon itself vs other vendors (either on Amazon or elsewhere on the Internet) is that I have confidence that the memory cards sold by Amazon itself are genuine.  there may be incredible deals elsewhere on the internet but in some cases the deals are too good to be true and counterfeit cards are being sold.Original review:Just received this today. Removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) and powered the unit back up and the storage was available.  No formatting required. Worked the first time out. Settings showed 29.71GB of total space (32GB version) and 29.71GB of free space.  I like the fact that a SD adapter came with it.  Should I ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy. (yes I can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if I ever swap this 32GB card out of my phone and replace it with a 64GB version, I can use this 32GB version via the adapter for other purposes.)",09-05-2012,943,5,0,5,5,1,0.565517535

123,Aleksandar Milivojevic,2,"I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn't work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.

My card came with an adapter that this card plugs into and it becomes a full sized SD card. If you are looking to use this in a camera or any other device that uses SD cards, please look elsewhere. These cards are not nearly as fast as the full sized SD cards used in cameras. The adapter should only be used for transporting data from the phone or other device, to a computer.

I found a video on youtube to learn how to insert the card since I could find nothing on it in the phone's user guide.  It's real easy. Turn the Note phone off. Remove the Note's back plate. You see a plaque saying SD card in the upper left quadrant of the phone. Simply place the microsd card face up with the metallic pins facing down and towards the right into the depressed slot area to the left of the SD card plaque. Then slowly and gently slide the microsd card under the plaque until it clicks. If it isn't in correctly, it will tend to move back out from under the plaque. Do not force. Replace the back plate on the phone. Turn the phone on.  Go to settings, storage.  At the bottom of the page, you will see SD Card.  If the microsd card was inserted correctly, you will see the additional GBs of storage displayed there.  You will also see Reformat SD card and Remove SD card.  Use these settings to erase data from the microsd card, and to remove it from the phone.  Do not try to remove the microsd card from the phone without first activating the Remove SD Card setting.  You can damage the card and the phone.  The card came quickly and San Disk is a reliable brand. It's great to have the Class 10 rating too.",23-01-2013,684,3,1,4,2,0.75,0.300641843

213,Amazon Customer,1,"Having used SanDisk before in my photography, I of course went to them when it was time to outfit my new Samsung Galaxy S3 with an internal microSD card. I spent the extra bucks over comparably ""no name"" Micro SD cards and bought this variant. I took quite a few pictures and even transferred an album from my computer so I coud show it to friends on the go.After less than two months, the SanDisk microSD card started acting up. It was not recognized, stopped, restarted, removed itself, reinstalled itself onto the phone - erratic behavior. Here is where I should have taken it out immediately and tried to recover anything I could before things hit the fan...unfortunately I waited too long and this morning, for no other reason than I turned my phone on, the card shows up as blank. Neither my Windows PC, nor my Mac, can even detect the card and yes, i tried two different adapters, and I tried the SanDisk recovery which ""found no recoverable files"" even though I checked all file type extensions.I've apparently lost all the pictures I had on there. To top it all off, my GF's cheap ""no name"" card has never had an issue in her exact same phone and keeps chugging along merrily.Paying a premium for a substandard product that fails in use after two months? No thanks. I'm going back to Lexar, which hasn't failed me yet. I'm also getting rid of all my SanDisk cards for my DSLR's, just in case.

They do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets, yet not so good with cameras, in fact these cards failed to work with my GoPro Hero3 camera and the customer service rep from Gopro claimed (and I happen to agree with him) that this card is not a true class 10 card let alone UHS-1.Benchmarks with my evo 4g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond 8mb/s while read speeds wondered around 25mb/s far below advertised speeds, well write speeds arent technically advertised (probably because they are of class 4 level)Benchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower (due to adapter) with write speeds around 6mb/s while read speeds wondered around 20mb/s.Needless to say, if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage, these are perfect. If you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however, I suggest you not to loose your money on this, because even if your write speeds are around 10mb/s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless.Again this review is based on GoPro camera and high definition raw recording..

I think this is just because the Galaxy S3 tends to get really hot right below the sd card which might damage it a bit. I don't think they put it in a good spot but that has nothing to do with the card itself so just get it if you want a nice sd card.,13-08-2013,482,0,0,0,0,0,0
273,Amazon Customer,5,"This is the best accessory that you can buy for your smartphone! Simple explanation:1) I loaded all my HD movies onto this micro SD card, inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3, and it plays them superbly without ANY delays, as it it up to 30mb/s read speed!2) The most important reason for this being the best accessory for your phone is to think about this: The premium you pay for an iPhone 64GB is $200. The price you pay for this 64GB micro SD card is $50 (depends on Amazon's pricing at the time). That means you get the same thing for $150 less, AND you can interchange your SD card between devices (if you buy a new tablet for example).No brainer.Note that it reads only at 10mb/s, so a 7GB HD movie will take about 10 - 15 minutes to load up.",13-01-2013,694,0,0,0,0,0,0

361,A. Mefford,5,"It is so hard to imagine that you can have 32 GB is something smaller than a postage stamp, yet here it is.I bought this card to work with my Call of Duty Ghosts Tactical Camera and it works perfectly.  The camera came with a 4 G card which I filled in just over an hour at the local Kart track.  I missed the last bit of our race due to insufficient capacity.  The battery was still going strong so I needed more card for recording my adventures.This card fits the bill nicely.As a UHS Speed Class 1 (roughly equiv Class 10) card this SD card is quite capable of any photographic or video need up to Full HD (not 2k or 4k).  I use a similar card in my Canon 60D and am able to hold around 700 raw images, and a few hours of HD video.Here are some benchmarks for comparison including this card.MacBook Pro Retina SSD430 MB/s write323 MB/s readGeneric Class 6 4GB (Came with Ghost Camera)9.8 MB/s write21 MB/s readSanDisk Extreme Class 10 8GB21 MB/s write23 MB/s readThis Card San Disk Ultra UHC 112 MB/s write45 MB/s readWhat does this mean?  It means that you should have no trouble recording HD video reliably with this card.  Your camera will be able to save pictures quickly to this card so it is ready to take the next shot.  If you fill the card completely it will take roughly 12 minutes to copy all the data off of the card, assuming the device you are copying to can keep up.The tests were done in the built in SD card drive of the MacBook Pro using the included SD Card Adapter.Based on my tests, I would say that if you don't really need a Micro SD, then you should buy a standard SD card, your performance might be better and the price should be lower.

You can expect speeds upto 28 MB/sec for WRITE, about 30MB/sec for READ, with the provided adapter, speeds ar always better for both read/write, using smartphone to read/write, speeds would be lesser mostly, but average should be 20mb/sec anyways as per what I've seen and I'm a heavy user, like if there is a 256GB microSDXC available, I would actually buy it, tried the Extreme version with 80mb/sec, costs 2 times of this one, but works similar to this, so dont waste money on name that doesnt deliver, buy this if you're buying to Sandisk",11-02-2013,665,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'll just try to provide some specifics from my experience in case if somebody is searching with these keywords. I've copied some WAV and MP3 files to this card from a fast PC (3.4 GHz, 16GB RAM, 7,200 RPM HDD, 64-bit Win 7, etc.) with a built-in card reader. The card reader maybe my bottleneck. Anyway, the observed average writing speed was around 9.5MB/s.Tried this card in Nokia 3555b. Logically this phone cannot read more than 8GB MicroSDHC cards, but it it. However, it saw the card as being only a 2GB card. Tried inMotorola Flipout Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Android Phone with Bluetooth, Camera, QWERTY Keyboard and Wi-Fi - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black. Played those WAV and MP3 files and it worked very well. Tried inMotorola MB520 Bravo Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 3MP Camera, FM Radio and GPS - US Warranty - Blackwith the same files, and it worked well too. No hiccups. Then inserted (and left it in) inBLU Studio 5.3 II Unlocked Dual Sim Phone with Dual-Core 1GHz Processor, Android 4.1, 5.3-inch IPS Capacitive Touch, and 8MP Camera - U.S. Warranty (Black).

Further, it is a good practice to have your &#34;personal&#34; stuff, like the things I just mentioned, saved to an external drive so as to not be in the mix should the horrific happen and you have to get your phone wiped.Word to the wise:  ENCRYPT YOUR STORAGE, both Primary Device and External SD.  For the Samsung Galaxy S4 (at least), that, in turn, requires that you use a phone unlock code of at least SIX characters, with at least one of them being non-numeric.  I know this can appear to be a pain in the butt, but the first time your device is ganked and you aren't panicking because your stuff is encrypted, you'll thank me.  Nekkid pictures aren't the only things of concern, mind you.  An unencrypted device, stolen by the wrong hands, isn't just $25 in crack cocaine money...it is much, much more than that in terms of lucrative identity theft opportunities.

615,"Bill MSN ""Rabbit Ears""",1,"Bought 2 of these for the wife's & my Android phone. When her's failed after 2 months, we figured it was just luck of the draw. Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate.EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this.Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn't buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell). Up until now I had an overall neutral to favorable opinion of them, not anymore.If you think I am overreacting, please just skim through a few pages submitted in springtime of 2013.

I added some music and videos onto the card using my Apple Macbook Air with no problems and then inserted it into the Note 2 with no problems and it immediately loaded everything with no problems. I have since taken it out and added some more music to it and it is working perfectly. I did not reformat or anything like that which was a great relief.

That being said it takes up A LOT of space, enough to fill a 64gb memory card on its own (a lot of the files are FLAC format.) I was a little hesitant to buy the 128gb card when it came out recently because with the 64gb cards the first batch were pretty much defective with resulted in a recall. Me, learning of the recall after looking up the issues I was having had to return the card I bought. SanDisk took the 64gb card back without hesitation and was actually prepared to do it without the serial number (since I couldn't open my phone at the time because the case is screwed on.)Note to everyone:Quite a few applications don't fully support NTFS or newer file system formats such as exFAT. To use your SD card without issues you have to format it to FAT32 which IS possible even though its over 32GB. Use the &#34;Fat32Format&#34; tool made by Ridgecrop Consultants, there's a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version available for those unfamiliar with using the command line.------After receiving my new card I formatted it to fat32 since I use a lot of applications that aren't the norm and it's easier to use an older file system that is compatible with everything made after 1996. The transfer of files and swapping of cards was seamless, my computer's micro-sd card reader recognized it without trouble as well as my phone. So far everything is good and there's been no hiccups.

Tried it on my gf's S4 and same problem.Apparently it comes formatted as exFAT and thought maybe reformatting it as FAT32 would solve the problem. Well I thought it did since my phone finally recognized it upon inserting it. A new problem arose, though. I started taking pictures to try it out and odd thing was some of the pictures became corrupted. Not even viewable on the phone seconds after taking them. Some worked, others not.Later on, I restarted my phone for some reason or other. A while later I wanted to check the pictures again and, surprise surprise, everything was gone. I'd find out later that every time I restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted. Tried it on my gf's phone and same thing happened.Tried reformatting again as FAT32 using GParted (couldn't hurt) and it just throws errors upon starting the write sequence.Too bad I can't return it as I had it shipped to me in Guatemala.

861,Cat Daddy,4,"The advertisement calls this card a ""class 10"" card however I was not able to get ""class 10"" speeds with this card. SD cards seem to be MUCH faster at read/write then microSD cards. I get about 10MB/s write speed when copying a file to my SD card through my phone USB cable. I get the same transfer rate when in an adapter. These small memory cards seem to be very limited on their write speed. Also, this card did heat up some when transferring to it for a long period of time continuously but not too bad...just warm. The read speeds seem to cap out at about 18MB/s but I did see 25MB/s on small files. One thing to note, and this may be by design for this particular card but, this card is super fast when transferring small files but slow at big files so you'll see slower write speeds the longer you write to it with larger files whereas smaller files zip along one at a time at that 10MB/s. I was getting 8.6MB/s when writing a 4.6GB movie file to this card. All in all, this is an excellent card and beyond worth the money for what you get. I love it for my EVO 4G LTE and my previous phone the EVO 4G. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it did not perform as advertised at 30MB/s.

I was pretty sure it would handle an 8GB card, but one never knows with these ever-changing specifications. Unfortunately, the documentation for this device was meager and written in pidgin English.OK, I'll buy it and give it a try. At worst, I swap out my 8GB card from a different device, which hopefully will handle the 16GB card.Well, too make a long story short (too late for that, eh?), the 16GB card works just fine. I put a bunch of my MP3s on the card, put it into the device, and sure enough, it recognizes and plays them.So, pretty much a done deal.

I was thrilled I copied a ton of music onto the card and used my phone as my mobile Ipod substitute, leaving my Ipod Classic on my desktop in its speaker system cradle.Everything worked fine until a couple of weeks ago. I started getting messages that seemed to say that I had removed and inserted the memory card. Of course, I hadn't touched it. Then a few days ago the phone told me that the card contained unsupported files and that I needed to reformat it. Well, I tried reformatting. After that, nothing. Nothing at all. I pulled the memory card, reset the phone. Reinserted the card. Nothing. I tried the card in the adapter on 3 computers. It wasn't even visible.I called Sandisk tech support. It didn't take terribly long to convince them that I had a problem. But they quickly offered me two 16 gb cards as a replacement. I literally laughed at them. I got the disturbing sense that this is something that they are required to try. If so, that's a lousy business practice. After bouncing me around a few time, they agreed to send me an RMA and a shipping label. I duly sent the card off a couple of days ago. To be frank, I have no idea at all when I might receive a replacement.If I weren't already in the grips of Sandisk, I would buy another card. The fact that 10% of the comments here are negative is an indication of a real quality control problem. A 10% fail rate is simply unacceptable for a product such as this.Update: Well, I do have to give Sandisk credit for customer support. I returned the card using the supplied UPS label on a Tuesday and I received a replacement by UPS on the following Monday. That's very good service. It does, however, increase my suspicion about the offer of two 16 gb because the 32 gb cards were ""out of stock."" If they were out of stock, they sure got ""in stock"" in a big hurry.

Compare that with a Transcend 4 GB Class 4 card, the write speed is nearly identical (7 to 9MB/s), while the read speed on the class four is 12 to 13MB/s, significantly slower, as expected.The read speed is good, but the write speed is abysmal!

1055,Craig,5,"Of late, Sandisk appears to have lost their way a little with their flash storage products. It's almost a universal truth that all of their USB flash drives are hopelessly slow; while they're usually reliable, transfer rates of 4MB/sec or less are worthless when filling a 32GB drive. Fortunately, their ""Ultra"" line of SD cards still appears to buck this trend.Formatted as NTFS and used in anelago Mobile Nano II reader, I see write speeds on a 64-bit Linux machine at a consistent 15-16MB/sec when copying large (1GB or larger) files to this card, which more than lives up to its class 10 billing. Reads appear to run at about 19-20MB/sec.I can't comment on reliability as I've only had the card a few days, but everything I've copied so far for testing has made it onto the card (and off again) with no corruption whatsoever; the MD5 checksum of every file I've transferred matches the source. That's more than can be said for the Supertalent Pico USB drive that this SD card and reader are intended to replace, which has never been quite right (it's always occasionally randomly corrupted files of larger than 100MB or so, and the probability of 1GB or greater files surviving was near zero).32GB appears to be the sweet spot at the moment; smaller cards don't cost that much less, and larger cards are beyond the SDHC spec and into SDXC territory, which isn't yet universal in terms of device compatibility (not to mention they cost far more than double for 64GB).For what I paid for this around Thanksgiving (not part of any explicit sale, but definitely a lower price than appears usual as far as camelcamelcamel is concerned) I'm extremely satisfied.Edit: I should also mention that the included mechanical full-size SD adaptor is one of the worst I've ever encountered. There's a lot of friction when the microSD card is inserted, and it's a right bugger to get it out of the adaptor again.

I've been through the SanDisk literature looking to see if there are any restrictions on their use, other than as ordinary &#34;flash memory&#34; for file storage.

I've had to resort to copying no more than 1/3 gb of data at a time to these cards, stopping, then starting another 1/3 gb until the complete data is copied.  The errors actually occur early on, at approximately the 2 to 3 gb point.  I have several other 128 gb flash memory sticks - the Lexar Echo series, as well as a hundred other lower-capacity flash memory cards, and do not have this overflow/error problem with any of those.

I spend several hours doing research for a good MicroSD card.  After reading couple articles online I found that all of my devices work great with MicroSDHC.There are a lot of choices to pick from on Amazon. However, I was debating between SanDisk, Transcend, and Samsung. I started to read Samsung MicroSD card reviews, and the first reviews were from 2012 which were 1 star, at least most of them due to the card not being a class 10.  Then I looked at the Transcend card and the reviews were good., but I was not so sure about the performance test.So the third one I looked at was SanDisk, and it appears to be the best choice for my devices just because it had so many reviews. I read a lot of reviews about this SD card and I was convinced to buy it.I have downloaded SanDisk Memory Zone for all of my devices.

1177,Darren S Dale,5,"I purchased two of these microSDXC cards when they were on sale around Black Friday, and have been using them now for just about two months. They work wonderfully and I have had absolutely no problems with either. These SanDisk memory cards are 64 GB microSDXC class 10, UHS-1 cards, which are rated for transfer speeds up to 30MB/sec.The UHS class 1 designation is intended as an performance measure that indicates the card is capable of supporting real-time full HD video recording. Of course, this only works if you are using a device which is capable of writing to the card at those speeds, but most modern devices that offer full HD recording, such as camcorders, digital SLR cameras, and cell phones with built in Full HD recording do support this standard. The benefit of using a UHS-1 card on a UHS certified device is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write fast enough.However, because these are extra high capacity, sdXC cards, you will need to make sure that your device can support microSDXC cards, and not simply microSD or microSDHC ones. The biggest difference is that the microSDXC standard uses the exFAT file system, rather than the FAT32 or NTFS systems. While most modern Android devices (and in fact most linux/unix devices) can handle that without difficulty some devices, such as older cameras, Android devices, and some Windows devices, may have difficulty with the format.Having said that, I've been using these in Nikon D80 & D7000 digital SLR cameras, as well as Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S Relay 4G phones without any difficulty, and they read & write fine on my computers.

The Transcend is rated slightly faster but the cameras seem to like either equally well.  When I purchased this Transcend and the SanDisk were within pennies of each other, so aside from slight price and speed differences, there's not much to recommend one over the other.

For SDHC memory cards, 32GB is the largest size available under that technology standard, so I went with this one from Sandisk. That way I didn't have to worry about compatibility issues with any of my devices. I've used Sandisk memory products for a number of years along with many other brands, and I've always had good results from them. I'm happy to say that my experience with this card echoes that of 5,000+ other Amazon users; it's been rock steady, reliable with larger file transfers (several 2GB+ movies at a time), and performed as quickly as I'd hoped for a Class 10 card in regards to its read/write times.Aside from the existing reviews and my previous experiences with Sandisk products, I also picked up this particular card due to its UHS-1 compliance. I don't currently have any UHS-1 devices that can take advantage of the increased speed, but for the negligible cost difference, it just made sense.

I think I may have bought too much.This card is advertised as water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof and shock proof. I will have totake their word for it. I am not going to test it.Just for fun I put the 16GB MicroSDHC disc (30MB/s Read Speed) into its provided adapter and used itin my cheapo cheapo Toshiba Camileo HD movie camera. Even at the Full High Definition resolution of1080p/30fps this disc performed very well. No stuttering, no missed frames and all this under low lightconditions. Nice. Very Nice. Those are big files at Full HD resolution. Read on...This card is 'USH-1' enabled which means it is the fastest card available (allegedly) and should reachup to a bus interface speed of 104 MB/s; if the electronic device you are using requires it. Of courseif your card reader or device does not support that speed you will be transferring data at your usualspeed. Sort of like saying it is backward compatible but don't expect blazing speeds. You can feeddata through only so fast.Transferring RAW photos and a Full HD digital film can take a lot of time to transfer. Those are hugefiles to transfer so the USH-I enabled disc is perfect for that purpose. They are working on USH-IIwhich is supposed to allow up to 300MB/s transfers.

Since the other three are used by non-techno people, I am not sure if they are still working or not.When I contacted SanDisk, they gave me test instructions, which of course all failed the tests.

I should not expect anything back, but who knows.For $6 more I have another unit, and I can tell you it will not be a SanDisk Ultra. Oh, well, the average price for the 3 remaining units will then be $34 (33% more than the purchase price).If I get a replacement, I will update this message.Update:I got an e-mail from SanDisk to advise me that they did receive the item and it is being processed. Shipping without tracking cost me $0.65 vs. $20. At least I have to give their customer service (or return department?) credit for being honest.

1472,Dustin D,4,"I use this in my Samsung Galaxy SIII and it has been great. There have been a few instances when the card was not recognized, but simply rebooting the phone fixed the problem. I am unsure whether this is a Samsung issue (probably), or a SanDisk issue, but it has only happened 2 to 3 times over the course of a year and a half. Overall, the write speeds are fast enough that you can record 1080p video directly to the card, which is exactly what I wanted it for. It does come with a full-size SD card enclosure, allowing you to use this in devices that require that type of memory card. Recommended!",16-02-2014,295,0,0,0,0,0,0

Highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade. With that being said, beware of fakes! I originally purchased one off of ebay, not paying attention to its location.

In fairness to ADATA, who failed to make good on any of the several defective products I purchased from them, I have never had to test SanDisk's warranty as I've never had a failure.

They are manufactured in China and these rip off companies are selling fake cards at a competitive price, but don't be fooled. If the price seems unbelievable that is because you will end up with a card that is not only less capacity then you are paying for, but a lower class and sometimes a faulty card altogether.When it comes to storage, pay the extra cash to get something reliable. Like this SanDisk Ultra 64 GB SDXC Class 10 memory card. It is blazaing fast and works well in my HTC EVO LTE Android phone.Side note: This card brings my total phone storage capacity to 158 GB.

I also use my tablet for sheet music, so I needed to have the capability to have all that on there, too.
